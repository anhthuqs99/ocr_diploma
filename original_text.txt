Forgotten dream, I draw it again in my heart
Collect all of the times I withdrew and swallow it, eh.
Small memories wake me up one by one
It opens me up, as if it'll fill the whole world
Past the long, long night -Past it
Want to embark on the road for a trip again - Now
Why not? In this world, one word that awakens my heart.
